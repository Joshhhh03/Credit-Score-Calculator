Credit Score Calculator (Alternative Data)
A modern credit scoring solution that evaluates loan applicants using alternative financial data such as rent payments, utility bills, education, and cash flow. Designed to improve financial inclusion for individuals with insufficient traditional credit history.

Problem Statement
Traditional credit scoring systems exclude about 49 million Americans who lack sufficient credit histories. Using alternative data sources, we can improve access to fair credit assessments while maintaining transparency and explainability.

Project Structure
client/ – Frontend app (UI components, dashboard, forms)

Config: vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts

Features
Core
Alternative Data Ingestion – Rent, utilities, education, cash flow, and more

Sample Scoring Formula
A simple weighted model for illustrative purposes:

markdown
Copy
Edit
Final Score = (Rent Payment History × 0.35)  
            + (Utility Bill History × 0.25)  
            + (Cash Flow Stability × 0.20)  
            + (Education Level × 0.10)  
            + (Other Positive Indicators × 0.10)
Rent Payment History: % of on-time payments in the last 12 months

Utility Bill History: % of bills paid before due date

Cash Flow Stability: Income consistency and variance over 6–12 months

Education Level: Mapped to score tiers (e.g., High School = 0.6, Bachelor’s = 0.8, Postgraduate = 1.0)

Other Indicators: e.g., mobile bill history, subscription payments

Weights can be adjusted after testing to improve fairness and accuracy.

Dashboard Layout Idea
Top Section:

Current credit score (large number, color-coded)

Short approval recommendation (e.g., “Low Risk”, “Moderate Risk”, “High Risk”)

Middle Section:

Bar chart showing factor contributions to score

Historical score trend (if data is available)

Bottom Section:

Personalized suggestions (e.g., “Maintain consistent rent payments for 3 more months to reach Good tier”)

Educational tips (e.g., “Diversify income sources to improve cash flow stability”)
